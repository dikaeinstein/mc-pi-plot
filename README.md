# mc-pi-plot

Approximating PI (π) using Monte Carlo technique.

This was implemented with Golang and the hep(High Energy Physics) package `hplot` for visualization.

There are other packages provided by hep, if you are interested in analysis in hep, check out [go-hep](https://go-hep.org/).

This was influenced by the gopher academy blog article:

- [*Computing and plotting π with Gonum and a zest of Monte Carlo*](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2018/montecarlo/)

This is one of those articles were is not the code but what you learn at the end.
